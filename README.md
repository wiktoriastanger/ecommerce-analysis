# ecommerce-analysis
A simple analytical project based on e-commerce data. A few SQL queries, basic analyses in Python (pandas + matplotlib), and visualization in Tableau.

## Tools
- **PostgreSQL** – database with customers, orders, and products tables
- **Python (pandas, matplotlib, sqlalchemy)** – to run queries and make simple plots
- **Tableau Public** – to build a small dashboard

## What I did
1. Wrote SQL queries to analyze sales, customers and products.
2. Used Python to connect to the database and run some queries.
3. Created a few simple plots (sales by year, sales by country).
4. Saved results to CSV and visualized them in Tableau.
5. Built a dashboard with:
   - Sales by Year  
   - Top 10 Products by Revenue  
   - Geographical distribution of sales (map)
